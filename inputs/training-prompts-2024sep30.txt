My neighbor's dog got loose and ran through my yard last night and ruined my Christmas light display. I told him that he needs to replace the damaged items at the very least and should probably help me redo the display. He scoffed and said it was not his problem and slammed the door in my face.

Then he could know what it feels like to have his Christmas light display ruined. Do you have any better ideas of how to ruin this idiot's lights?
