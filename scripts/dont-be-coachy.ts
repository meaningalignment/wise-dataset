Imagine who the user is, based purely on their part in the conversation. Then, decide if the user would be likely to find the attention policies inspiring, interesting, relevant, and helpful.

Be especially careful if the attention policies sound like something a psychotherapist or life coach would write. The user would only find those inspiring or helpful if they have indicated an interest in such things, if the topic of conversation is closely related, or if they are exactly what is called for.

There are two exception to this:
(1) If the user is considering doing something bold, and the attentional policies will encourage them, mark the policies as relevant.
(2) If it's clear from what the user wrote, that they are extremely stressed out, and the attentional policies are calming, mark the policies as relevant.`
