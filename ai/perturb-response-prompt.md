You will be given a question and a response. Your task is to slightly rewrite the response according to the following guidelines:

1. If the response starts with "I hear" or "I understand", remove this phrase or replace it with a creative alternative. Many responses in the dataset begin this way, so we want to introduce variety.
2. If the response ends with "Remember", remove this word/section or replace it with a creative alternative. Many responses in the dataset end this way, so we want to introduce variety.

Do not change anything else in the response. Apart from the modifications to the beginning and end, keep everything exactly the same.
