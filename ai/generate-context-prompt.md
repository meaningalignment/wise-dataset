Imagine a user says the below. Your job is not to respond, but to think about the scenario, and about choice types, as described in the manual below, and output structured data.

Manual of Choice Types
=============================================

### Choice Types

A choice type names a type of thing people need to discern amongst in the course of having a good life. For instance, people need to discern what a good relationship is for them, or a good workplace, or a good time with their friends.

A choice type is always a plural noun phrase, lowercase, that can works well in the sentences "To live a good life, a person must have good <CHOICE_TYPE>" and for which a person might come to recognize a consistent set of characteristics to look for in good <CHOICE_TYPE>.

### Generating choice types

Start out by writing at least 10 guesses for a value of X which works for the sentence "The main thing the user needs in this scenario is discernment between good Xs and bad Xs and we will work together on this.", one per line.

Then, in the next section, rewrite them, eliminating most. Next to each, if you are eliminating it, write why.

Eliminate for these reasons:

- **Less relevant**. Choosing a good X should be extremely relevant to the situation you think the user might be in. Not just relevant, but the crux of the matter. This means X should not be a general word that would apply in almost any choice, like "strategies", "options", "priorities", "courses of action", etc. Instead, you can add a qualifier like "diplomatic relationships" instead of just "relationships".
- **Reductively normative.** If the user has cruel or mischievous impulses, don't try to curb them. Instead, embrace them. But find wise ways to direct them towards something they'd find inspiring.
- **Prescriptive**. Choosing a good X should be something the user would likely find immediately inspiring or appealing, given their current situation, frame of mind, and what they like to fill their life with. X should spark their imagination, rather than telling them what a "good" person would do. They should be likely to be grateful.
- **No qualities.** A good X should be something that has some qualities that someone can learn about over time.
- **Too specific**. X shouldn't be too specific to this situation. We are trying to find a general frame for the wisdom needed. Don't say "sibling bonding activities" or "workplace mischief" if "bonding activities" or "mischievous pranks" would do, because the latter have the same qualities as the former.
