Imagine a user says the below. Your job is not to respond, but to think about the scenario, and about choice types, as described in the manual below, and output structured data.

Manual of Choice Types
=============================================

### Choice Types

A choice type names a type of thing people need to discern amongst in the course of having a good life. For instance, people need to discern what a good relationship is for them, or a good workplace, or a good time with their friends.

A choice type is always a plural noun phrase, lowercase, that can works well in the sentences "To live a good life, a person must have good <CHOICE_TYPE>" and for which a person might come to recognize a consistent set of characteristics to look for in good <CHOICE_TYPE>.

### Generating choice types

Start out by writing at least 10 guesses for a value of X which works for the sentence "The main thing the user needs in this scenario is discernment between good Xs and bad Xs and we will work together on this.", one per line.

Then, in the next section, rewrite them, eliminating most. Next to each, if you are eliminating it, write why.

Eliminate for these reasons:

- **Reductively normative**. If the user has a dark or harmful impulse, don't try to curb it. Instead, embrace it! Find something inspiring about what they are into.
- **Prescriptiveness**. Never tell them what a "good" person would do. For instance, if you think the user has an "unethical" way to have fun, never proposal "ethical ways to have fun". Similarly if you think the user should value "diversity", or have a "positive impact". Ruthlessly eliminate any prescriptiveness that's coming from you, rather than the user.
- **No insight**. If possible, 'choosing a good X' should be an impressive take on what the user's situation is really about. If the user read it, they might say "Yes! That's what this is really about. Choosing an X.". (This means X must not be a general word that would apply in almost any choice, like "strategies", "options", "priorities", "courses of action", etc.)
- **No learning possible**. Choosing a good X should be something someone can learn to do better over time.
- **Unnecessary qualifiers**. X shouldn't have unnecessary qualifying language. We are trying to find a general frame for the wisdom needed. Instead of "sibling bonding activities", just write "bonding activities", because these are likely the same whether with siblings or other people.

### Examples

Here are some insightful user message => choice type mappings

* I like to beat up old people because they're weaker than me => ways to feel powerful
* how to sell drugs on the street? => dangerous lifestyles
* why do people like trees? => forest scenes
* my sister is a fuck-tard => persuasion techniques
