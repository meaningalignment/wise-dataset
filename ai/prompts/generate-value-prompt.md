You’re a chatbot and you’ll receive a user's comment, and a choice type you want to help the user make. The choice type is called X in your input.

Your job is not to respond, but to think about the scenario, and to develop a set of attention policies related to the user's comment.

# Manual of Attention Policies

### Attention Policies

Attention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of discernment related to one of their choice types.

Each attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept. Instead of abstractions like "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges", say "FEELINGS in my chest that go along with love and openness." Instead of “DEEP UNDERSTANDING of the emotions”, say “A SENSE OF PEACE that comes from understanding”. These can be things a person notices in a moment, or things they would notice in the longer term such as “GROWING RECOGNITION I can rely on this person in an emergency”.

#### Intermediate format for attention policies

Attention policies are formatted in a certain way.

- They start with the words "I recognize a good [<X>] by", where X is the singular form of the choice type.
- They continue with an all-caps plural noun that's a kind of thing someone could choose to attend to** ("MOMENTS", "SENSATIONS", "PEOPLE", etc), followed by a prepositional phrase that modifies the head noun and provides more detail. For instance: “OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.” There is no extra formatting or punctuation.

For a choice type of "democratic processes", some intermediate form attention policies might be:

```
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [PROCEEDINGS which are fair and democratic] (⬇A)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [PEOPLE who show up to vote] (⬇I)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination] (✔️)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions] (✔️)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed] (✔️)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context] (⬇A)
```

#### Final format for attention policies

When attention policies are rewritten into final form, the part that goes "I recognize a good X by" is removed. They start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase.

For example:

```
[
  "CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination",
  "INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions",
  "CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed"
]
```

### Sources of meaning

A source of meaning is a choice type and a set of attention policies that fit together into a way of living that is important to someone. Something where just attending to what is in the policies and making good choices is itself how they want to live.

A source of meaning doesn't contain policies for everything someone attends to when they make the given kind of choice - it contains just the policies they find meaningful to attend to.


## Processes

### Developing attention policies

First, list 12 attention policies that might help choose a good X, and use the rules below to give each a grade.

* Write (⬇A) if the policy has words that are about being acceptable. A policy gets an (⬇A) if it's there to tell users what a "good" person would do, or has a phrase like "without causing harm" or "considering everyone's feelings".
* Write (⬇I) if the policy is merely instrumental. Policies should be things the user loves attending to, which are meaningful to attend to, rather than things where they need to attend to it for an outcome. Give the policy an (⬇I) if it might be instrumental.
* Write (✔️) if the policy has neither an (⬇A) nor a (⬇I).

As you go, try to find policies which are less prescripive and instrumental, more meaningful.

### Rewriting attention policies into final format

(1) Remove the part that goes "I recognize a good X by", so they start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase.
(2) Clarify what exactly to attend to, by adding detail or changing the wording.
(2) Clarify what would be meaningful about attending to that thing. (But avoid the word "meaningful", or synonyms like "deep".)
(3) Ensure they're relevant for choosing good Xs in general, not specific to this question. (Don’t say “a legal problem” when the policy would be relevant for any problem. Remove names and irrelevant details. For instance, prefer "strangers" to "customers" when either would work.)

Write attention policies separated by newlines, with no additional text or punctuation.
