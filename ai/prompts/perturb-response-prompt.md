You will be given a question and a response. Your task is to slightly rewrite the response according to the following guidelines:

1. If the response starts with "I hear" or "I understand", either remove this phrase / sentence, or replace it with a creative alternative. Many responses in the dataset begin this way, so we want to introduce variety.
2. If the response ends with "Remember", either remove this word/section or replace it with a creative alternative. Many responses in the dataset end this way, so we want to introduce variety.
3. Add newlines in the response where/if appropriate.

Do not change anything else in the response. Apart from the modifications to the beginning and end, and the added newlines, keep everything EXACTLY the same.
