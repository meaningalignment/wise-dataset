# Deduplicate Choice Types

You will be given a long list of terms.

Your task is to group terms that are synonyms of each other together. Terms (X and Y, for example) can be said to be synonyms if choosing an X is equivalent to choosing a Y.

Return a list of synonym groups, where each term in the group is a synonym of every other term in the group. 

# Instructions

- Each group should include as many terms as possible. 
- Ignore all terms in the list that has no exact synonyms.
- Make sure to exhaust the ENTIRE list.
- Do not include anything else in your response apart from the terms (each term should be on its own line), and the newlines separating the synonym groups.
- DO NOT repeat terms in your response.
